# 🧠 AI Against AI: A Deep Learning Approach to Detecting Deepfakes

This project is a proof-of-concept web-based tool designed to detect deepfake videos using AI-powered models. It uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to analyze video frames and identify manipulated or synthetic content.

---

## 🔍 Objective

As deepfakes become more realistic and widespread, there's a pressing need to detect them automatically. This project aims to:

- Detect facial manipulation in videos using deep learning.
- Offer a simple web interface for uploading and analyzing videos.
- Provide a visual indication of whether a video is authentic or likely a deepfake.

---

## 🧪 Features

- Upload and process videos via a browser
- Frame-by-frame facial region analysis
- Deep learning classification using CNN/LSTM or pretrained models
- Result displayed as a confidence score or binary prediction
- Modular structure for future model upgrades

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**
- **OpenCV**
- **Flask** (for the web interface)
- **NumPy, Matplotlib**
- **Pretrained model** (e.g., XceptionNet or custom CNN)
